Who is missing? Where have they gone? Were they kidnapped? If so, who is responsible? To get to the bottom of this mystery, we will use visual analytic techniques to analyze data provided by GAStech to assist with law enforcement’s investigation and hopefully find the missing persons and bring them home safely. The data provided by GAStech covering the two weeks prior to the GAStech employees’ disappearance are as follows:\r\nMovement and tracking data from GAStech’s company cars which have GPS tracking,\r\nGAStech employee’s credit card transactions and Kronos Kares loyalty card data.\r\nObjective\r\nThe objective of this project is to use visual analytic techniques to surface and identify anomalies and suspicious behavior. More precisely, we aim to shed light on the following questions:\r\nUsing just the credit and loyalty card data, identify the most popular locations, and when they are popular. What anomalies do you see? What corrections would you recommend to correct these anomalies?\r\nAdd the vehicle data to your analysis of the credit and loyalty card data. How does your assessment of the anomalies in question 1 change based on this new data? What discrepancies between vehicle, credit, and loyalty card data do you find?\r\nCan you infer the owners of each credit card and loyalty card? What is your evidence? Where are there uncertainties in your method? Where are there uncertainties in the data?\r\nGiven the data sources provided, identify potential informal or unofficial relationships among GASTech personnel. Provide evidence for these relationships.\r\nDo you see evidence of suspicious activity? Identify 1- 10 locations where you believe the suspicious activity is occurring, and why.\r\nLiterature Review\r\nWe reviewed the submissions for VAST Challenge 2014 for a better appreciation of approaches and techniques adopted to solved Mini-Challenge 2. We summarise below useful methodologies we wish to consider for our project.\r\nThe DAC-MC2 team from Virginia Tech used a methodology called Points of Interest (“POI”) to identify POIs such as people’s homes, their work places, and recreational locations (e.g. restaurants, cafes). A location is considered a POI if the time spent at a location is more than 5 minutes and the location has a diameter of less than 50 meters. They then graphed the distribution of POI over time for various days (weekdays and weekends) and locations (i.e. home, work, recreation).\r\nSimilarly, the MiddlesexMASS-Attfield-MC2 team from Middlesex used the Patterns of Life (“POL”) suite to create a map showing where each person was at any given time and for how long. They also overlayed credit card and loyalty transactions over their map.\r\nTo better understand the credit card and loyalty card data, the IIITH-YASHASWI-MC2 team from the International Institute of Information Technology Hyderabad visualized the distributions of credit card transactions by date and by person and employment title / employee title. This analysis enabled them to better understand typical patterns and identify transactions that deviated and stood out.\r\nThe Purdue-Guo-MC2 team from Purdue University created a Social Relationship Matrix, which involves plotting a heatmap of the number of times GAStech employees meet each other over the course of the two weeks. The assumption is that the more frequent people meet, the closer relationship they have between them.\r\nApproach\r\nQuestion#\r\nObjective\r\nProposed Approach\r\nQ1\r\nUsing just the credit and loyalty card data, identify the most popular locations, and when they are popular. What anomalies do you see? What corrections would you recommend to correct these anomalies?\r\nTo determine the most popular locations, we will create a heatmap visualization where the rows and columns represent time and location, respectively. The color of a cell will indicate the count of all transactions (popularity). The darker cells identify the locations that are most popular and when. To detect the anomalies, we will use the plot_anomaly_diagnostics() function of timetk package to identify outliers from the credit card and loyalty card transactions. We plan to retain all anomalies detected until we have made a thorough investigation and considered all the data provided.\r\nQ2\r\nAdd the vehicle data to your analysis of the credit and loyalty card data. How does your assessment of the anomalies in question 1 change based on this new data? What discrepancies between vehicle, credit, and loyalty card data do you find?\r\nWe assume that only the assigned driver will always drive the car to get from one location to another. We will adapt the POI methodology to identify homes, workplaces and recreational locations. To further assess the anomalies identified in question 1, we will create a heatmap for each location of: * No. of credit card or loyalty card transactions, and * No. of vehicle IDs passing through. We may focus on unsuspecting POIs (e.g. homes) and analyse vehicle IDs that pass through those POIs.\r\nQ3\r\nCan you infer the owners of each credit card and loyalty card? What is your evidence? Where are there uncertainties in your method? Where are there uncertainties in the data?\r\nLeveraging on the POI methodology outlined in Question 2, we will cross-reference location and credit card activity to identify owners of credit card and loyalty card. To infer the owners of each card, we will develop a word cloud of GAStech employee names associated with a credit card and loyalty card combination. The employee name that is the largest suggests a higher co-occurrence of the credit card and loyalty card being associated with that employee. For the above proposed approaches, we recognise that the driver of the car might be different than the assigned name, the person making the credit card/loyalty card transactions could be different from the driver, etc.\r\nQ4\r\nGiven the data sources provided, identify potential informal or unofficial relationships among GASTech personnel. Provide evidence for these relationships.\r\nTo identify relationships, we will plot a heatmap of all GAStech employees versus GAStech employees as a social relationship matrix. Each cell represents the number of times they meet. The more often they meet, the darker the color of the cell. The names of the employees may be color-coded by their departments for us to analyse any suspicious inter-department relationships. Source: Purdue-Guo-MC2 team from Purdue University * To classify an identified relationship as official or unofficial, we will analyse whether: * The meetings occur during working hours * The persons meeting work for the same department\r\nQ5\r\nDo you see evidence of suspicious activity? Identify 1- 10 locations where you believe the suspicious activity is occurring, and why.\r\nTo mark on the Abila, Kronos map the identified locations of suspicious activities, based on our analyses performed for Questions 1 to 5. We will make the map interactive by including “tooltips” so when a user hovers over a location, a prompt will appear with a description of when the suspicious activity occurred and the persons involved.\r\nData Preparation\r\nGAStech provided four datasets/tables for our analysis (see Table 1).\r\nDataset\r\nField name\r\nRemarks\r\ncc_data.csv\r\ntimestamp\r\nBy date-hour-minute\r\ncc_data.csv\r\nlocation\r\nname of the business\r\ncc_data.csv\r\nprice\r\nreal\r\ncc_data.csv\r\nLast4ccnum Last 4 digits of the credit or debit card number\r\n\r\nloyalty_data.csv\r\ntimestamp\r\nBy date\r\nloyalty_data.csv\r\nlocation\r\nname of the business\r\nloyalty_data.csv\r\nprice\r\nreal\r\nloyalty_data.csv\r\nloyaltynum\r\nA 5-character code starting with L that is unique for each card\r\ngps.csv\r\ntimestamp\r\nBy date-hour-minute\r\ngps.csv\r\nid\r\ninteger\r\ngps.csv\r\nlat\r\nlatitude\r\ngps.csv\r\nlong\r\nlongitude\r\ngps.csv\r\nlocation\r\nCalculated field based on lat and long\r\ncar-assignments.csv\r\nLastName\r\n\r\ncar-assignments.csv\r\nFirstName\r\n\r\ncar-assignments.csv\r\nCarID\r\ninteger\r\ncar-assignments.csv\r\nCurrentEmploymentType\r\nDepartment; categorical\r\ncar-assignments.csv\r\nCurrentEmploymentTitle\r\njob title; categorical\r\nTable 1: Metadata for credit card transactions, loyalty card transactions, GPS tracking and car assignments.\r\nWe have performed preliminary exploratory data analysis (EDA) on credit card transactions (see Figure 1) and observed that Katerina’s Café conducts significantly more transactions than other locations, suggesting that it is very popular among GAStech employees.\r\nFigure 1: Frequency count of transactions by location\r\nOur EDA on boxplots of transaction prices by location revealed some outliers in transactions for several merchants, particularly Frydos Autosupply (see Figure 2), that warrants further investigation.\r\nFigure 2: Boxplot of transaction prices by location\r\nWe will join the tables together to try to paint a more holistic picture of the events that occurred and answer the questions above. Figure 3 shows how the tables will be joined.\r\nFigure 3: Table relations for car-assignments, gps, cc_data, and loyalty data.\r\nThe cc_data and loyalty_data tables do not have explicit keys to use for joining, but the tables do have price and timestamp which may be sufficient proxies to bring the data together. However, the loyalty card timestamp is by date only whereas the credit card transactions timestamp is by date-hour-minute. Therefore, we make two underlying assumptions for joining these tables. First, there are no two transactions with the exact same price and timestamp values. Second, the timestamps from the cc_data and loyalty_data tables match.\r\nWe will also join all four tables together: cc_data, loyalty_data, gps tables, and car-assignments. As there are no obvious keys to join these tables together, we propose to create a calculated field in the gps table called “location” using the latitude and longitude coordinates. We will use this new “location” field together with timestamp to join car-assignments and gps with cc_data and loyalty_data.\r\nApart from the data in these four tables, we also have a map of Abila, Kronos (MC2-tourist.jpg). However, the map does not have coordinates. To plot the vehicle tracking GPS data onto the map, we will use the shapefiles for Abila, Kronos to geo-reference the map.\r\nFigure 4: Map of Abila, Kronos geo-referenced with streets\r\nTechnology\r\nFor geo-referencing, we will use an open-source geographic information system called QGIS.\r\nThe primary technology we will use for our investigation and analysis is the programming language R. We will explore various R packages to determine the best visualization of the GPS data (see below for a preliminary list). We may use Tableau to facilitate our preliminary visualization before determining R packages with the right balance between insights and ease of use to the reader.\r\nSf package for vector data handling\r\nRaster package for raster data handling\r\nStar package for spatio-temporal data handling\r\nTmap package for thematic maps to visualize spatial data distribution including choropleths and bubble maps\r\nRShiny for the creation R Shiny interfaces\r\nshinyWidgets for the customization of input widgets of the Shiny App\r\ntidyverse including its collection of R packages for performing various data analysis\r\nplotly for the creation of interactive graphics and cahrtes\r\nrgdal for the binding of Geopstatial Data Abstraction Library\r\nTimetk for the visualization, wrangling and feature engineering of time series data\r\nDeliverables\r\nThe output from the project will be:\r\nAn interactive R Shiny dashboard for law enforcement to leverage as part of their investigation. The dashboard will come with a user guide that shows the law enforcement how to use the data visualisation functions designed.\r\nA poster showcasing the key visuals of interest and summarizing the key insights from the project.\r\nA detailed report detailing the approach and discussing the findings from the project\r\nTeam Members\r\nArchie Quiambao DOLIT\r\nKevin Magic Rialubin SUNGA\r\nNurulasyiqah Mohammad TAHA\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

Then, select a bar from the bar chart. Doing so will modify the Credit Cards by Locations heatmap as well as the Transaction Values for Selected Location boxplot. \r\nThe Credit Cards by Locations heatmap will be filtered by the location chosen in step 1. Use the tooltip to explore the transactions in the heatmap. \r\nThe Transaction Values for Selected Location boxplot will also be filtered by the location chosen in step 1. Check the boxplot for any suspicious transactions. \r\n1.2 Loyalty Card Data\r\nUse this tab to explore loyalty card data.\r\nStart by selecting a date range for the transactions. Then, select a bar from the bar chart. Doing so will modify the Loyalty Cards by Locations heatmap. \r\nThe Loyalty Cards by Locations heatmap will be filtered by the location chosen in step 1. Use the tooltip to explore the transactions in the heatmap. \r\nThe Suspected Outliers for All Locations boxplot is not filtered by location. To see the details of the boxplot, use the zoom feature. \r\n1.3 Credit Card + Loyalty Data\r\nUse this tab to see locations and days where credit card and loyalty card transactions could not be matched to its corresponding loyalty card and credit card transaction. \r\n2.0 Patterns of Life Kinematics\r\n2.1 GPS Movement\r\nUse this tab to understand patterns of life: where people go, what time, and for how long.\r\nThe tab defaults to car ID 1, date range January 6, 2014 - January 19, 2014, and 0:00 to 24:00 hours.\r\nSelect the car ID(s), date range, and time you want to explore. \r\nZoom in to see the POIs more closely. By zooming in, you can see the distribution of POIs (whether there’s few or many) and the colors of the POIs which indicate duration become more distinct.\r\nHover over individual POIs to see details about the person, their arrival, departure, and time spent at that location. \r\n2.2 Owners Identification\r\nUse this tab to identify the likely owners of each credit card.\r\nThere are several ways to start. We will walk through one approach that has worked well for us. First, filter for one credit card using the data table filter. Second, filter for a location using the data table filter. Locations that are less popular work best. The heatmap is useful for finding the best locations to use. \r\nUse the date filter for the map to narrow down the POIs that match the date of the transaction from step 1. Use the lasso selection tool to select the POIs near the location from step 1. The data table on the right will surface the details of POIs selected. \r\nTo match the credit card with the POI, compare the transaction time with the arrival and departure times. The transaction time should fall between the arrival and departure times. It is possible that multiple people meet this condition. They are candidates for possible owners of the credit card. To further narrow down the list of candidates, iterate through steps 1 and 2 using different transactions. The last candidate is the likely owner of the credit card.\r\nThe last step is to match the credit card with the loyalty card. Use the data table filter to filter for the credit card. The data table will show the loyalty card(s) that match based on a joined table using transaction details (date and price). \r\n2.3 Credit Card and Loyalty Card Matching\r\nThis tab has the matching results from Owner Identification module.\r\n3.0 Relationship Networks\r\n3.1 Organizational Chart\r\nUse this tab to explore the organizations and employees in GASTech.\r\nClick on any node in the tree to expand it. \r\nThe table is interactive with the tree. To hide the table, click on the checkbox. \r\n3.2 Spending Habits\r\nUse this tab to explore unofficial relationships between GASTech employees.\r\nThere are several filters on this view: date, hour, day of week, and department. We recommend starting with the default filters to get a high level view and using the filters to hone in on specific relationships. \r\nSelect the network layout to use. Play around with this setting to see how your network is visualised. We recommend testing layout_with_fr and layout_nicely. \r\nTo interact with the network graph, use the select by id drop down or click on the network graph directly. \r\nInteracting with the graph will generate a data table with details of the transactions that occurred at that location. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

With our users’ objectives in mind, we structure our application to start at a high-level aggregation. From there, we incorporate the following interactive dynamics: navigating, filtering and sorting, selecting, and sharing annotations to enable the user to drill down to more granular levels of detail.\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 1: Left: Interaction Framework. Right: Drill Down Framework.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn addition to the packages in Figure 2, we use several geospatial R packages for handling the movement data: sf, raster, and tmap. We also use visNetwork and collapsibleTree for visualising networks. For interactivity, Plotly is invaluable especially given its compatibility with ggplot.\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 2: R Packages\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nResults\r\n\r\nSpending\r\nThe bar chart in Figure 3 shows the number of transactions at each location. Selecting a bar from the chart generates a box plot that enables a drill down into anomalous transactions at that location.\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 3: Top: Bar Chart of Number of Transactions by Location., Bottom: Box plot of Transactions at Selected Location.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPatterns of Life\r\nFigure 4 is a visualisation of vehicle paths and points of interest (POI). Clicking on a POI surfaces a tooltip that surfaces details such as duration of stay at the POI.\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 4: Car ID 28 Vehicle Path on 2014-01-06 Shows Irregularities\r\n\r\n\r\nFigures 5 and 6 bring together financial and movement data. Through the use of filtering and selecting, it is possible to identify the owner of a credit card by narrowing down who was at a given location when a credit card transaction was made.\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 5: Table of Credit Card Transactions Filtered for 2014-01-12 and Desafio Golf Course\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 6: Top image: POIs on 2014-01-14.
