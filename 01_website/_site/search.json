We deployed V-ASK to the R Shinyapps.io platform so that analytical tasks can be performed by toggling various widgets without requiring any coding or programming knowledge.\r\n1. Introduction\r\nVAST Challenge 2021 – The Kronos Incident (Mini-Challenge 2) presents a mystery on the fictional island country of Kronos where several employees of GASTech, a Tethys gas multinational, went missing between 20 and 21 Jan 2014. Law enforcement has sought assistance with their investigation into the disappearance. GASTech had provided the following data that covered two weeks prior to its employees’ disappearance: (a) GASTech employee’s credit card transactions and Kronos Kares loyalty card data, and (b) movement and tracking data from GASTech’s company vehicles which have GPS tracking.\r\nIn the real world, we can reasonably expect law enforcement’s investigations into crime and suspicious activities to involve, at the very least, an analysis of transactional and movement data. Therefore, we endeavoured to use visual analytical techniques to surface anomalies and suspicious activities from the fictional GASTech datasets by building a web-enabled analytical tool, the “Visual Analytics of Spending and Kinematics (V-ASK)” application. Ultimately, this tool could be used by real world law enforcement if their investigation involves transactional and movement data, and interactions between both datasets.\r\nThis paper reports on our work designing, building and deploying a web-enabled client-based analytical tool to support law enforcement’s exploration and analysis of both transactional data and movement data, within six sections. Section 1 provides the background and general introduction of this paper, while section 2 shares the motivation and objective of our work. Section 3 reviews past work and highlights our sources of inspiration, e.g. “Points of Interest” concept, as well as summarises the R packages used to building our interactive application. Section 4 details our user interface design process and section 5 highlights key insights drawn from using our application. Finally, section 6 concludes with possible future work to build on the present work.\r\n2. Motivation and Objectives\r\nOur research work was originally motivated by the desire to simply fulfil the course requirements of ISSS608 – Visual Analytics and Applications as part of Singapore Management University’s Master of IT in Business programme. In reviewing past work, we found that past submissions to solve Mini-Challenge 2 relied on proprietary software which made reproducibility by the public difficult.\r\nTherefore, the objective of our research was to develop a user-friendly visual analytical tool, V-ASK app, to (a) explore transactional data, (b) understand movement data, (c) identify owners of financial cards, (d) discern informal relationships, and (e) identify anomalies and suspicious activities. We deploy V-ASK to the R Shinyapps.io platform, such that law enforcement officers may perform analytical tasks by toggling various widgets without requiring any coding or programming knowledge.\r\n3. Review of past works and R packages\r\nAs VAST Challenge 2021 is a redux of VAST Challenge 2014 with some variation, modified data and new questions, we reviewed past submissions for Mini-Challenge 2 for some inspiration on tackling this year’s challenge.\r\nWe were particularly drawn to the submission by DAC-MC2 team from Virginia Tech. They used a methodology called Points of Interest (“POI”) to identify POIs such as people’s homes, their workplaces, and recreational locations (e.g. restaurants, cafes). A location is considered a POI if the time spent at a location is more than 5 minutes and the location has a diameter of less than 50 meters. They then graphed the distribution of POI over time for various days (weekdays and weekends) and locations (i.e. home, work, recreation).\r\nAll previous submissions lacked interactivity and most of them had relied on proprietary softwares. Therefore, we sought to use an open-source platform, R, so that our app is reproducible and accessible. We also explored various R packages to enable us to build an interactive R Shiny App for exploration and analysis of transactional data and movement data. We downloaded the following packages from CRAN for the respective tasks:\r\nLoad and prepare data: ‘tidyverse’, ‘DT’, ‘profvis’\r\nWork with time and date data: ‘clock’, ‘lubridate’\r\nPlot graphs and visualisations: ‘ggplot2’, ‘ggforce’\r\nAdd interactivity to visualisations: ‘plotly’, ‘ggiraph’\r\nLoad maps and manipulate geo-spatial data: ‘rgdal’, ‘tmap’, ‘sf’, ‘raster’\r\nCreate collapsible tree diagrams: ‘collapsibleTree’\r\nPlot interactive network graphs: ‘igraph’, ‘ggraph’, ‘visNetwork’\r\nBuild Shiny app and associated customisations: ‘shiny’, ‘shinythemes’, ‘shinyWidgets’\r\n4. User interface design\r\nBefore we begin to design our analytical tool, we looked at the nature of datasets provided under Mini-Challenge 2: (a) credit card transactions of GASTech employees by date-hour-minute and without identifying card owner, (b) Kronos Kares loyalty card transactions of GASTech employees by date only and without identifying card owner, (c) GPS tracking of GASTech company cars and trucks, and (d) GASTech assignment of employees to company cars and their job designation/department.\r\nThe Mini-Challenge also provided a tourist map of fictional Abila, Kronos, where GASTech is based. As the map image file provided (MC2-tourist.jpg) does not have coordinates projection, we had to perform geo-referencing. We used a geographic information system software, QGIS, to geo-reference the image file with the Abila shapefile (in WGS84 coordinates) to obtain a geo-referenced tourist map (MC2-tourist.tif).\r\nTherefore, we designed our analytical tool with the following general approach: (i) to explore and draw insights from each dataset separately, and (ii) to explore and draw insights from combined datasets. At each level, the user will be provided with (i) a visual overview of the data, (ii) the option of interactive widgets to drill down to more detailed information, and (iii) tooltips or table for the lowest level information. To incorporate these approaches, the V-ASK App is arranged in R Shiny using navigation bars and tab panels as follows:\r\nHome – Overview of V-ASK and user guide\r\nSpending EDA – Separate tabs for exploratory data analytics for each transactional data, ‘Credit Card Data’ and ‘Loyalty Card Data’, and a tab for combined dataset.\r\nPatterns of Life Kinematics – ‘GPS Movement’, ‘Owners Identification’, the ‘Credit card and loyalty card matching’ tab will not be available for use by real life law enforcement\r\nRelationship Networks – ‘Organisational chart of GASTech’, ‘Spending habits’\r\nInsights – Showcase of anomalies and suspicious activities (this tab will not be available for use by real life law enforcement)\r\n4.1 ‘Spending EDA’ module\r\nUnder the ‘Credit Card Data’ tab, we first display an overview barchart of ‘Most Popular Locations by Frequency’ of credit card transactions. The tooltip of each bar will indicate the number of credit card transactions that took place at each location.\r\nMost popular locations by no. of credit card transactionsTo find out the credit card use over the period of two weeks at a certain location, the user may click on the bar for a location to generate a heatmap: ‘Credit Card by Location’. The tooltip of each tile in the heatmap will reflect the value of transactions made with a credit card at the selected location on the specified date. It would be atypical for a credit card to be used to make more than two transactions on the same day at the same location and such instances should be investigated further. When the user clicks on a bar in the bar chart, a boxplot ‘Transaction values by location” will be generated to identify any outlier transactions.\r\nTransaction values by locationIn this ‘Credit Card Data’ tab, the user may also explore the ‘Most Popular Locations by Hours of the Day’ heatmap, based on the cumulative period of two weeks. The user may filter the heatmap by date to understand the daily popularity of a location by hours of the day. When the user clicks on a tile, the ‘Credit Cards by Location’ heatmap and ‘Transaction values by location’ will be similarly updated to reflect this selection.\r\nThe ‘Loyalty Card Data’ tab enables the user to explore loyalty card data in a similar fashion. A key difference would be the heatmap ‘Most Popular Locations by Day of the Week’ as the loyalty card data timestamp is by date only. Also, the boxplot ‘Suspected Outliers for All Locations’ displays an overview of all loyalty card transactions, therefore providing a different perspective on identifying outlier transactions.\r\nMost popular location by day of the weekAs there is no one-to-one matching of credit card and loyalty card transactions, ‘Credit Card + Loyalty Card’ tab provides a quick overview of credit card transactions without a corresponding record in the loyalty card dataset, vice-versa, with the tooltip detailing the value of transaction.\r\n4.2 ‘Patterns of Life Kinematics’ module\r\nUnder the ‘GPS Movement’ tab, we first display an overview path of Car ID 1 over two weeks, as well as its POIs. The vehicle path, which traces the movement is colour-coded by the hour of the GPS coordinates to clearly highlight travel by various times of the day. The POIs, which represents stationary periods of a vehicle, are colour-coded by time spent at a POI. The most translucent blue reflects the vehicle being stationary for less than 1 hour, while the most opaque blue reflects the vehicle being stationary for more than eight hours. Using these visualisation techniques, we can clearly show where any individual goes, at what time and for how long.\r\nVehicle path and POIsThe user may refine the exploration of vehicle movement by toggling the following options: Car ID (multiple vehicles may be selected), dates (either a single date or consecutive dates), and time intervals within a day. Extensive exploration will reveal the likely places of residence, workplace and other regularly visited POIs for the GASTech employee assigned to each company car and possible suspicious activities.\r\nThe ‘Owners Identification’ tab allows the user to use both credit card data and movement data to infer likely owners of the credit card and loyalty cards. Firstly, the user may refer to the overview heatmap ‘Credit Card Spending Behaviour’ to select a credit card of interest. The credit card number of interest is keyed into the table to generate the list of all transactions made with that card.\r\nNext, the user should choose a transaction timestamp from the list and adjust the date range for the interactive map. The ‘lasso select’ tool should be used to select the approximate POI area on the interactive map. The interactive map table will list all vehicle IDs and name of GASTech employee (for assigned company cars only) that stopped at the POI area.\r\nAt the same time, the user should key in the credit card number of interest into the credit card-loyalty card matching table to find the most likely loyalty card connected to a credit card by virtue of its common owner. Our extensive exploration generated the list of matched loyalty cards, credit cards, cards’ common owner and assigned Car ID in the ‘Credit Card and Loyalty Card Matching’ tab.\r\n4.3 ‘Relationship Networks’ module\r\nIn the ‘Organisational Network’ tab, we first display GASTech’s organisational chart at the department level as an overview. User may click on each ‘department’ node to expand the tree into the job titles held within the department. Clicking on the ‘title’ node would expand the tree into the specific employee names. Each time a node is expanded, the data table will be updated to reflect the full detail of the GASTech employee name, assigned Car ID, department and job title.\r\nGASTech organisation treeIn the ‘Spending Habits’ tab, we first display the network graph of GASTech employees visiting and transacting at various locations over the two-week period. The user must toggle with the following to focus on a specific sub-graph of the otherwise complicated overview graph and perform any meaningful analysis to identify unofficial relationships between GASTech employees: date of transaction (single date or consecutive dates), time interval of the day (e.g. lunch time, night time), day(s) of the week and (multiple) departments. The user may also explore by clicking on ‘location’ nodes to review which employees across departments gather at common times, suggesting the formation of unofficial relationships.\r\nUnofficial relationships5. Key insights\r\nCross-exploration of the tabs in the V-ASK app is limitless. We share some key insights from our exploration.\r\n5.1 ‘Spending EDA’\r\nBased on a combination of various visualisations under the ‘Spending EDA’ tab, we found that Katerina’s Café is popular throughout the week with the bulk of their customers transacting during lunch and dinner.\r\nKaterina’s Café PopularityFrydos Autosupply n’ More reported an outlier transaction of $10,000 on 13 Jan 2014, since their transactions typically range between $83 to $236. Further investigation should be performed on this transaction. \r\n5.2 ‘Patterns of Life Kinematics’\r\nFrom the ‘GPS Movement’ tab, we can generally identify the normal place of residence for employees assigned with a company car if we set the time interval from 9.00pm to 12.00am and refer to the POI location.\r\nThe image below showcases the daily routine of the executive team including their places of interests and corresponding time of day. \r\nThe image below provides evidence of a big dinner party on January 10 attended by GASTech employees from Engineering and Information Technology Deparments. \r\n5.3 ‘Relationship Networks’\r\nBased on the interactive network of transactions graph, we observe that the truck drivers tend to form a community of their own, separate from the rest of the GASTech employees. This could largely be due to the nature of their work that involves driving to far locations such as Abila Airport.\r\nTruck Driver CommunityFrom the same graph, we also found unexpected relations at the Chostus Hotel during office hours, which warrant further investigation. \r\n5.4 Suspects\r\nUpon exploring all three modules of V-ASK App, we shortlist the following individuals as suspects responsible for the disappearance of their GASTech colleagues: Isia Vann, Hennie Osvaldo, Hideki Cocinaro and Bertrand Ovan. Coincidentally, three of them are from the Security department, except for Bertrand Ovan. \r\n6. Conclusion\r\nThe exploration of the V-ASK App demonstrates that the feasibility of using visual analytics techniques to analyse transaction data and movement data. Further, movement data can complement transaction data through network graphs to gain further insights.\r\nV-ASK App has room for further enhancements. For example, we can plot employee-to-employee network graphs across various time periods to incorporate the element of time and generate spatial movement networks. We can also plot a network graph of credit card and loyalty cards to visually identify mappings that deviate from one credit card to one loyalty card.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

Introduction\r\nDuring 20-21 Jan 2014, on the island country of Kronos, several employees of GAStech, a Tethys gas multinational, go missing. Who is missing? Where have they gone? Were they kidnapped? If so, who is responsible? To get to the bottom of this mystery, we will use visual analytic techniques to analyze data provided by GAStech to assist with law enforcement’s investigation and hopefully find the missing persons and bring them home safely. The data provided by GAStech covering the two weeks prior to the GAStech employees’ disappearance are as follows:\r\nMovement and tracking data from GAStech’s company cars which have GPS tracking,\r\nGAStech employee’s credit card transactions and Kronos Kares loyalty card data.\r\n2. Objective\r\nThe objective of this project is to use visual analytic techniques to surface and identify anomalies and suspicious behavior. More precisely, we aim to shed light on the following questions:\r\nUsing just the credit and loyalty card data, identify the most popular locations, and when they are popular. What anomalies do you see? What corrections would you recommend to correct these anomalies?\r\nAdd the vehicle data to your analysis of the credit and loyalty card data. How does your assessment of the anomalies in question 1 change based on this new data? What discrepancies between vehicle, credit, and loyalty card data do you find?\r\nCan you infer the owners of each credit card and loyalty card? What is your evidence? Where are there uncertainties in your method? Where are there uncertainties in the data?\r\nGiven the data sources provided, identify potential informal or unofficial relationships among GASTech personnel. Provide evidence for these relationships.\r\nDo you see evidence of suspicious activity? Identify 1- 10 locations where you believe the suspicious activity is occurring, and why.\r\n3. Literature Review\r\nWe reviewed the submissions for VAST Challenge 2014 for a better appreciation of approaches and techniques adopted to solved Mini-Challenge 2. We summarise below useful methodologies we wish to consider for our project.\r\nThe DAC-MC2 team from Virginia Tech used a methodology called Points of Interest (“POI”) to identify POIs such as people’s homes, their work places, and recreational locations (e.g. restaurants, cafes). A location is considered a POI if the time spent at a location is more than 5 minutes and the location has a diameter of less than 50 meters. They then graphed the distribution of POI over time for various days (weekdays and weekends) and locations (i.e. home, work, recreation).\r\nSimilarly, the MiddlesexMASS-Attfield-MC2 team from Middlesex used the Patterns of Life (“POL”) suite to create a map showing where each person was at any given time and for how long. They also overlayed credit card and loyalty transactions over their map.\r\nTo better understand the credit card and loyalty card data, the IIITH-YASHASWI-MC2 team from the International Institute of Information Technology Hyderabad visualized the distributions of credit card transactions by date and by person and employment title / employee title. This analysis enabled them to better understand typical patterns and identify transactions that deviated and stood out.\r\nThe Purdue-Guo-MC2 team from Purdue University created a Social Relationship Matrix, which involves plotting a heatmap of the number of times GAStech employees meet each other over the course of the two weeks. The assumption is that the more frequent people meet, the closer relationship they have between them.\r\n4. Approach\r\nQuestion#\r\nObjective\r\nProposed Approach\r\nQ1\r\nUsing just the credit and loyalty card data, identify the most popular locations, and when they are popular. What anomalies do you see? What corrections would you recommend to correct these anomalies?\r\nTo determine the most popular locations, we will create a heatmap visualization where the rows and columns represent time and location, respectively. The color of a cell will indicate the count of all transactions (popularity). The darker cells identify the locations that are most popular and when. To detect the anomalies, we will use the plot_anomaly_diagnostics() function of timetk package to identify outliers from the credit card and loyalty card transactions. We plan to retain all anomalies detected until we have made a thorough investigation and considered all the data provided.\r\nQ2\r\nAdd the vehicle data to your analysis of the credit and loyalty card data. How does your assessment of the anomalies in question 1 change based on this new data? What discrepancies between vehicle, credit, and loyalty card data do you find?\r\nWe assume that only the assigned driver will always drive the car to get from one location to another. We will adapt the POI methodology to identify homes, workplaces and recreational locations. To further assess the anomalies identified in question 1, we will create a heatmap for each location of: * No. of credit card or loyalty card transactions, and * No. of vehicle IDs passing through. We may focus on unsuspecting POIs (e.g. homes) and analyse vehicle IDs that pass through those POIs.\r\nQ3\r\nCan you infer the owners of each credit card and loyalty card? What is your evidence? Where are there uncertainties in your method? Where are there uncertainties in the data?\r\nLeveraging on the POI methodology outlined in Question 2, we will cross-reference location and credit card activity to identify owners of credit card and loyalty card. To infer the owners of each card, we will develop a word cloud of GAStech employee names associated with a credit card and loyalty card combination. The employee name that is the largest suggests a higher co-occurrence of the credit card and loyalty card being associated with that employee. For the above proposed approaches, we recognise that the driver of the car might be different than the assigned name, the person making the credit card/loyalty card transactions could be different from the driver, etc.\r\nQ4\r\nGiven the data sources provided, identify potential informal or unofficial relationships among GASTech personnel. Provide evidence for these relationships.\r\nTo identify relationships, we will plot a heatmap of all GAStech employees versus GAStech employees as a social relationship matrix. Each cell represents the number of times they meet. The more often they meet, the darker the color of the cell. The names of the employees may be color-coded by their departments for us to analyse any suspicious inter-department relationships. Source: Purdue-Guo-MC2 team from Purdue University * To classify an identified relationship as official or unofficial, we will analyse whether: * The meetings occur during working hours * The persons meeting work for the same department\r\nQ5\r\nDo you see evidence of suspicious activity? Identify 1- 10 locations where you believe the suspicious activity is occurring, and why.\r\nTo mark on the Abila, Kronos map the identified locations of suspicious activities, based on our analyses performed for Questions 1 to 5. We will make the map interactive by including “tooltips” so when a user hovers over a location, a prompt will appear with a description of when the suspicious activity occurred and the persons involved.\r\n5. Data Preparation\r\nGAStech provided four datasets/tables for our analysis (see Table 1).\r\nDataset\r\nField name\r\nRemarks\r\ncc_data.csv\r\ntimestamp\r\nBy date-hour-minute\r\ncc_data.csv\r\nlocation\r\nname of the business\r\ncc_data.csv\r\nprice\r\nreal\r\ncc_data.csv\r\nLast4ccnum Last 4 digits of the credit or debit card number\r\n\r\nloyalty_data.csv\r\ntimestamp\r\nBy date\r\nloyalty_data.csv\r\nlocation\r\nname of the business\r\nloyalty_data.csv\r\nprice\r\nreal\r\nloyalty_data.csv\r\nloyaltynum\r\nA 5-character code starting with L that is unique for each card\r\ngps.csv\r\ntimestamp\r\nBy date-hour-minute\r\ngps.csv\r\nid\r\ninteger\r\ngps.csv\r\nlat\r\nlatitude\r\ngps.csv\r\nlong\r\nlongitude\r\ngps.csv\r\nlocation\r\nCalculated field based on lat and long\r\ncar-assignments.csv\r\nLastName\r\n\r\ncar-assignments.csv\r\nFirstName\r\n\r\ncar-assignments.csv\r\nCarID\r\ninteger\r\ncar-assignments.csv\r\nCurrentEmploymentType\r\nDepartment; categorical\r\ncar-assignments.csv\r\nCurrentEmploymentTitle\r\njob title; categorical\r\nTable 1: Metadata for credit card transactions, loyalty card transactions, GPS tracking and car assignments.\r\nWe have performed preliminary exploratory data analysis (EDA) on credit card transactions (see Figure 1) and observed that Katerina’s Café conducts significantly more transactions than other locations, suggesting that it is very popular among GAStech employees.\r\nFigure 1: Frequency count of transactions by location\r\nOur EDA on boxplots of transaction prices by location revealed some outliers in transactions for several merchants, particularly Frydos Autosupply (see Figure 2), that warrants further investigation.\r\nFigure 2: Boxplot of transaction prices by location\r\nWe will join the tables together to try to paint a more holistic picture of the events that occurred and answer the questions above. Figure 3 shows how the tables will be joined.\r\nFigure 3: Table relations for car-assignments, gps, cc_data, and loyalty data.\r\nThe cc_data and loyalty_data tables do not have explicit keys to use for joining, but the tables do have price and timestamp which may be sufficient proxies to bring the data together. However, the loyalty card timestamp is by date only whereas the credit card transactions timestamp is by date-hour-minute. Therefore, we make two underlying assumptions for joining these tables. First, there are no two transactions with the exact same price and timestamp values. Second, the timestamps from the cc_data and loyalty_data tables match.\r\nWe will also join all four tables together: cc_data, loyalty_data, gps tables, and car-assignments. As there are no obvious keys to join these tables together, we propose to create a calculated field in the gps table called “location” using the latitude and longitude coordinates. We will use this new “location” field together with timestamp to join car-assignments and gps with cc_data and loyalty_data.\r\nApart from the data in these four tables, we also have a map of Abila, Kronos (MC2-tourist.jpg). However, the map does not have coordinates. To plot the vehicle tracking GPS data onto the map, we will use the shapefiles for Abila, Kronos to geo-reference the map.\r\nFigure 4: Map of Abila, Kronos geo-referenced with streets\r\n6. Technology\r\nFor geo-referencing, we will use an open-source geographic information system called QGIS.\r\nThe primary technology we will use for our investigation and analysis is the programming language R. We will explore various R packages to determine the best visualization of the GPS data (see below for a preliminary list). We may use Tableau to facilitate our preliminary visualization before determining R packages with the right balance between insights and ease of use to the reader.\r\nSf package for vector data handling\r\nRaster package for raster data handling\r\nStar package for spatio-temporal data handling\r\nTmap package for thematic maps to visualize spatial data distribution including choropleths and bubble maps\r\nRShiny for the creation R Shiny interfaces\r\nshinyWidgets for the customization of input widgets of the Shiny App\r\ntidyverse including its collection of R packages for performing various data analysis\r\nplotly for the creation of interactive graphics and cahrtes\r\nrgdal for the binding of Geopstatial Data Abstraction Library\r\nTimetk for the visualization, wrangling and feature engineering of time series data\r\n7. Deliverables\r\nThe output from the project will be:\r\nAn interactive R Shiny dashboard for law enforcement to leverage as part of their investigation. The dashboard will come with a user guide that shows the law enforcement how to use the data visualisation functions designed.\r\nA poster showcasing the key visuals of interest and summarizing the key insights from the project.\r\nA detailed report detailing the approach and discussing the findings from the project\r\n8.

Then, select a bar from the bar chart. Doing so will modify the Credit Cards by Locations heatmap as well as the Transaction Values for Selected Location boxplot. \r\nThe Credit Cards by Locations heatmap will be filtered by the location chosen in step 1. Use the tooltip to explore the transactions in the heatmap. \r\nThe Transaction Values for Selected Location boxplot will also be filtered by the location chosen in step 1. Check the boxplot for any suspicious transactions. \r\n1.2 Loyalty Card Data\r\nUse this tab to explore loyalty card data.\r\nStart by selecting a date range for the transactions. Then, select a bar from the bar chart. Doing so will modify the Loyalty Cards by Locations heatmap. \r\nThe Loyalty Cards by Locations heatmap will be filtered by the location chosen in step 1. Use the tooltip to explore the transactions in the heatmap. \r\nThe Suspected Outliers for All Locations boxplot is not filtered by location. To see the details of the boxplot, use the zoom feature. \r\n1.3 Credit Card + Loyalty Data\r\nUse this tab to see locations and days where credit card and loyalty card transactions could not be matched to its corresponding loyalty card and credit card transaction. \r\n2.0 Patterns of Life Kinematics\r\n2.1 GPS Movement\r\nUse this tab to understand patterns of life: where people go, what time, and for how long.\r\nThe tab defaults to car ID 1, date range January 6, 2014 - January 19, 2014, and 0:00 to 24:00 hours.\r\nSelect the car ID(s), date range, and time you want to explore. \r\nZoom in to see the POIs more closely. By zooming in, you can see the distribution of POIs (whether there’s few or many) and the colors of the POIs which indicate duration become more distinct.\r\nHover over individual POIs to see details about the person, their arrival, departure, and time spent at that location. \r\n2.2 Owners Identification\r\nUse this tab to identify the likely owners of each credit card.\r\nThere are several ways to start. We will walk through one approach that has worked well for us. First, filter for one credit card using the data table filter. Second, filter for a location using the data table filter. Locations that are less popular work best. The heatmap is useful for finding the best locations to use. \r\nUse the date filter for the map to narrow down the POIs that match the date of the transaction from step 1. Use the lasso selection tool to select the POIs near the location from step 1. The data table on the right will surface the details of POIs selected. \r\nTo match the credit card with the POI, compare the transaction time with the arrival and departure times. The transaction time should fall between the arrival and departure times. It is possible that multiple people meet this condition. They are candidates for possible owners of the credit card. To further narrow down the list of candidates, iterate through steps 1 and 2 using different transactions. The last candidate is the likely owner of the credit card.\r\nThe last step is to match the credit card with the loyalty card. Use the data table filter to filter for the credit card. The data table will show the loyalty card(s) that match based on a joined table using transaction details (date and price). \r\n2.3 Credit Card and Loyalty Card Matching\r\nThis tab has the matching results from Owner Identification module.\r\n3.0 Relationship Networks\r\n3.1 Organizational Chart\r\nUse this tab to explore the organizations and employees in GASTech.\r\nClick on any node in the tree to expand it. \r\nThe table is interactive with the tree. To hide the table, click on the checkbox. \r\n3.2 Spending Habits\r\nUse this tab to explore unofficial relationships between GASTech employees.\r\nThere are several filters on this view: date, hour, day of week, and department. We recommend starting with the default filters to get a high level view and using the filters to hone in on specific relationships. \r\nSelect the network layout to use. Play around with this setting to see how your network is visualised. We recommend testing layout_with_fr and layout_nicely. \r\nTo interact with the network graph, use the select by id drop down or click on the network graph directly. \r\nInteracting with the graph will generate a data table with details of the transactions that occurred at that location. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

With our users’ objectives in mind, we structure our application to start at a high-level aggregation. From there, we incorporate the following interactive dynamics: navigating, filtering and sorting, selecting, and sharing annotations to enable the user to drill down to more granular levels of detail.\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 1: Left: Interaction Framework. Right: Drill Down Framework.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn addition to the packages in Figure 2, we use several geospatial R packages for handling the movement data: sf, raster, and tmap. We also use visNetwork and collapsibleTree for visualising networks. For interactivity, Plotly is invaluable especially given its compatibility with ggplot.\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 2: R Packages\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nResults\r\n\r\nSpending\r\nThe bar chart in Figure 3 shows the number of transactions at each location. Selecting a bar from the chart generates a box plot that enables a drill down into anomalous transactions at that location.\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 3: Top: Bar Chart of Number of Transactions by Location., Bottom: Box plot of Transactions at Selected Location.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPatterns of Life\r\nFigure 4 is a visualisation of vehicle paths and points of interest (POI). Clicking on a POI surfaces a tooltip that surfaces details such as duration of stay at the POI.\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 4: Car ID 28 Vehicle Path on 2014-01-06 Shows Irregularities\r\n\r\n\r\nFigures 5 and 6 bring together financial and movement data. Through the use of filtering and selecting, it is possible to identify the owner of a credit card by narrowing down who was at a given location when a credit card transaction was made.\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 5: Table of Credit Card Transactions Filtered for 2014-01-12 and Desafio Golf Course\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 6: Top image: POIs on 2014-01-14. The POIs closest to the Desafio Golf Course are selected. Bottom image: The details of the selected POIs in tabular format.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRelationship Networks\r\nFigure 7 visualises the official relationships of GASTech employees using Collapsible Tree and an interactive data table.\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 7: Top: Tree Visualisation of GASTechs Engineering Drill Technician Department. Bottom: Table Rendering of the Tree.\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 8 is an interactive network of transaction data, which has been enriched by credit card ownership mapping generated from the ‘Patterns of Life Kinematics’ module\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 8: Left: Network for transactions made at Chostus Hotel. Right: The details of the transactions from Chostus Hotel.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFuture Work\r\nEmployee-to-employee network graph using movement data to capture relationships that do not involve transaction data.\r\nNetwork graph of credit card and loyalty cards to visually identify mappings that deviate from 1 credit card to 1 loyalty card. For example, 1 credit card to multiple loyalty cards.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
