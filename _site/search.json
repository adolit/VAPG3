      "description": "[Mini-Challenge 2]((https://vast-challenge.github.io/2021/MC2.html)) asks us to analyze movement and tracking data. GAStech provides many of their employees with company cars for their personal and professional use, but unbeknownst to the employees, the cars are equipped with GPS tracking devices. The company provides Kronos Kares benefit card to GASTech employees by giving them discounts and rewards in exchange for collecting information about their credit card purchases and preferences as recorded on loyalty cards.\n\nUsing the tracking data and financial transaction for the past 2 weeks leading to the disappearance of some company employees, our mission is to identify which GASTech employees made which purchases and identify suspicious patterns of behavior. \n\nAs a visual analytics professionals, we must also cope with uncertainties that result from missing, conflicting, and imperfect data to make recommendations for further investigation.",

Overview\r\nVAST Challenge 2021 mini-challenge 2 includes various csv and geospatial files providing clues on the preparation of Protector of Kronos (POK) in kidnapping GASTech employees.\r\n2. Project Motivation\r\nUsing the data in mini-challenge 2, the objective of the project is to analyze the movement and tracking of GAStech employees via the vehicle GPS data. The credit card purchases, and loyalty usage data will be used to identity anomalies in the financial transactions.\r\n3. Data\r\nFrom mini-challenge 2, we will join the credit card and loyalty data using the timestamp, location, and price. It will help us determine the most popular locations. The additional information from the loyalty and last4accum will hopefully detect possible anomalies.\r\nThe GPS tracking data projected on the geospatial files will help us analyse the movements of different employees. Adding the vehicle data to the credit card and loyalty data will hopefully uncover discrepancies. The car assignment, location indicated in credit card, loyalty, and GPS data will help to infer the owners of the credit cards.\r\nThe possible anomalies from the credit card purchases and discrepancies from the vehicle movements will provide evidence on the suspicious activities.\r\n4. Relevant Works\r\n4.1 Georgia Institute of Technology\r\nThey created interactive 3D map visualizations of where individuals are.\r\nThey created a map of GPS data.\r\nThere are many data points. It seems challenging to figure out what’s worth paying attention to.\r\n\r\n4.2 Virginia Tech\r\nThey use a framework called POI or points of interest which is roughly defined as having spent more than 5 mins at the location.\r\n\r\n4.3 Central South University\r\nGood visualisation, Intuitive and easy to understand\r\n\r\n4.4 Fraunhofer IAIS and City University London\r\nThe semantic space is a good tool to show different relationships\r\n\r\n4.5 Middlesex University\r\nGood use of patterns of life atlas tool\r\nThe car id is selectable and does not clutter the visualisation\r\n\r\n4.6 Nanyang Technological University Singapore\r\nUse basic tools like excel to perform the visualisation\r\nNot interactive\r\n\r\n4.7 University of Konstanz\r\nShows a very complex looking data transformation to derive insights\r\n\r\n4.8 Tennessee Tech University\r\nNot very useful. It did not discuss how insights were derived\r\n\r\n4.9 CERTH-ITI\r\nUsed proprietary tool\r\nNo actual mapping\r\nDisplay credit card transactions over time in a day to determine routine (day v time, user v day, day v location, user v location)\r\n\r\n4.10 Georgia Institute of Technology\r\nUsed D3, Matlab (Analytics-based)\r\nNot mapped to Abila\r\nTracking data (lines) and spending data (circles)\r\nMatrix view\r\nTimeline view\r\n3D Space-time cube view –> coloured lines overlap so difficult to follow trail\r\nIdentified Lucas Alcazar was not present when high-value purchase was made at Frydo’s Autosupply\r\nUsed proprietary web-based tool\r\nTo map movement on Abila\r\nBy car/person\r\nBy time period\r\nHeatmap of employee vs transactions –> Used to confirm other findings\r\n\r\n4.11 International Institute of Information Technology Hyderabad\r\nUsed geotools.org, QGIS, D3.js\r\nSimple frequency count of transactions (credit card and loyalty card) by date to detect patterns\r\nSimple frequency count of transactions (credit card and loyalty card) by employee name/ shop to detect patterns\r\nLook at car GPS pattern/ frequency throughout the day and by date\r\n\r\n4.12 Peking University\r\nUsed Python, D3.js, QGIS\r\nPerform hierarchical clustering on car owners based on general car pattern on weekday-weekend.\r\nAnimated temporal view of car path\r\nPeriodic time brush + event time line\r\nSpatial temporal exploration design\r\nVery neat summary of location and event timeline (24-hr ring)\r\nInteractive selection of location to show 24-hr timeline\r\n\r\n4.13 Purdue University\r\nUses HTML5, CSS, SVG, JavaScripts, jQuery, PHP, MySQL and D3 to query, compute, serve and visualize data.\r\nDodeca-Rings Map\r\nSimilar to Peking Uni’s spatial temporal exploration design + multiple rings for multiple cars\r\nSocial relationship matrix\r\nMore meetings, darker color\r\nSimple concept\r\n\r\n4.14 University of Buenos Aires - Alcoser\r\nUsed Tableau, Excel, Sql Server 2012, Spss, Qgis\r\nSimple frequency count of transactions by date to detect patterns\r\n\r\n4.15 University of Buenos Aires - Croceri\r\nUsed Tableau 8.1, QGis, Excel 2010, SAS Enterprise Guide\r\nHeatmap for car patterns/frequency\r\nTreemap of purchases at different times of the day\r\nBubble graphs (different sizes) of purchases by employee\r\nBoxplot of purchases at each supplier\r\nScatterplot of speed to identify outliers\r\n\r\n4.16 University of California, Davis\r\nApart from plotting car path, there’s barely any data analytics performed\r\n\r\n5.
