title: "About  VAST Challenge 2021: Mini-Challenge 2"
description: |
  [Mini-Challenge 2]((https://vast-challenge.github.io/2021/MC2.html)) asks us to analyze movement and tracking data. GAStech provides many of their employees with company cars for their personal and professional use, but unbeknownst to the employees, the cars are equipped with GPS tracking devices. The company provides Kronos Kares benefit card to GASTech employees by giving them discounts and rewards in exchange for collecting information about their credit card purchases and preferences as recorded on loyalty cards.
  
  Using the tracking data and financial transaction for the past 2 weeks leading to the disappearance of some company employees, our mission is to identify which GASTech employees made which purchases and identify suspicious patterns of behavior. 
  
  As a visual analytics professionals, we must also cope with uncertainties that result from missing, conflicting, and imperfect data to make recommendations for further investigation.
